# Operations runbooks of <slug>-system (environment-level work, run on a schedule):
#   Restore test          weekly, first environment: point-in-time restore into a temporary database (CAP-060);
#                         only in a system with a database
#   Rotate SQL password   monthly, every environment: new administrator password through Key Vault (CAP-056); only
#                         in a system with a database
#   Health report         hourly, every environment: asks every node the environment's stack reports and its public
#                         address, one line each; the last run per environment is the system's health in Octopus
#                         (CAP-076). A deployable with hosting "own" is no node of the stack: the report asks the
#                         nodes its application recorded (environments/<env>/nodes.json, read from the repository's
#                         public address, without a token), once an hour, which wakes a node that scaled to zero; a
#                         record with "healthReport": false is left alone. An environment with nothing to ask says
#                         so and succeeds
#   Failover test         only with a standby region (environments[].standbyLocation): stops the primary app and times
#                         the Front Door endpoint's switch to the standby and back (CAP-047); it may run in every
#                         environment with a standby, and is scheduled monthly in the nonprod ones
#   Restart apps          only with a deployable that declares secrets (deployables[].secrets): restarts the container
#                         apps that read secrets of their own and waits until each answers its health path. A value
#                         the operator wrote to the vault reaches an app when Container Apps reads it, within 30
#                         minutes of the write, not with the restart: the runbook waits that long and says what it
#                         saw. On demand in every environment, never on a schedule
# A schedule runs the runbook's published snapshot; the system workflow publishes one after every apply.
# The instance's task cap is shared by every system on it, so each system's schedules start at its own time: an offset
# of 0 to 239 minutes derived from the slug (the same on every apply), after 07:00 UTC for the restore test and after
# 08:00 UTC for the rotation.
